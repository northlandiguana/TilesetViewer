# Tileset Viewer

[http://northlandia.com/TilesetViewer](http://northlandia.com/TilesetViewer)

A simple viewer for classic slippy map tilesets, based on Leaflet. Simply provide the tileset URL (including an accecss token if required) or visit the [Leaflet Providers Preview](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) site and enter the provider name for the tileset you want to view. No bells and whistles here; this is simply a viewbox for tiles with nothing else to get in the way. You must use a scroll wheel or two-finger touch to zoom.
